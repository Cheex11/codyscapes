				<h1>A Quick Bio</h1>
				<p>Nothing makes me happier than coming in from a day of shooting photographs and watching my computer fill with small thumbnails of captured beauty.  In that moment, it feels like walking through a library - my mind overwhelmened by potential.  I chase that feeling and love sharing my final products with whomever will look at them.</p>
				<p>I wasn't always this way.  I grew up in a typical Texas home that exalted sports.  It wasn't until my senior year of college that I bought my first camera.  Since then, photography has pulled me all over the world serving as a catalyst to great experiences and friendships.</p>
				<p>I'm currently traveling aroung North America chasing the right seasons and locations to grow my portfolio.  You can follow my attempts on my <a href='/map'>live map</a> page which shows my most recent photo I felt worthy of sharing or on <a href='http://www.instagram.com/codyscapes' target='_blank'>instagram</a>.</p>
