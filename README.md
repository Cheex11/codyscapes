# Codyscapes

This is my first attempt at building a Django App. It is currently hosted on Heroku.

The app will serve as a homepage for my photography.  There will be three main areas:

1. Gallery
2. Live Map
3. About me

MVP:
1. Mobile Layout for "Live Map" page
2. Build out "About Me"
3. Scroll listeners in "Live Map"
4. Enter Data
5. Backup database
6. "Live Map" - if link contains 'youtube' logic to show videos
7. Show Purchase link on "Live Map"
8. Purchase Link Logic and layout

Later Date:
1. Automatic URL upload to S3.
2. Email list
3. Add Blog Post ID for an image
