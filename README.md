2. Live Map
3. About me

5. Backup database
6.

8. Purchase Link Logic and layout

11. Add Facebook / Insta icons / links
12. Update "Live Map" buffer at bottom

1. Automatic URL upload to S3
2. Email list
3. Add Blog Post ID for an image
4. CLick photo on live map index column, show bigger image
5. Scale google maps pin icon to zoom level
6. Move map JS to own js file
7. Use a better way to scale video iframe (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11122249/scale-iframe-css-width-100-like-an-image)
